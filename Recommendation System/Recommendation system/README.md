# Description

A new Abuja-based online Comedy TV is seeking to optimise its content using customer ratings. Its contents are bought from popular comedy shows that are held in different parts of Nigeria. Therefore it is important for the company to understand which content makes business sense based on customer rating. In addition, it desires to offer personalised experience to each online viewer by delivering best comedy content that are most relevant to each viewer in its growing community of online and offline followers.
